# BooksController Class Documentation

The `BooksController` class is a REST controller in a Spring Boot application that provides endpoints for managing books in a digital library system. It allows CRUD operations on books, as well as search functionality based on various criteria like title, publish date, ISBN, and popularity.

## Class Overview

### Package
`com.example.DigitalLibraryStore.controllers`

### Dependencies
- **`BookServiceImpl`**: Handles the business logic related to book management.

### Annotations
- **`@RestController`**: Marks the class as a REST controller.
- **`@RequestMapping`**: Base URL for endpoints is not explicitly defined, but it assumes `BooksController` handles book-related requests.

---

## Constructor
The constructor uses **dependency injection** to initialize `BookServiceImpl`.

```java
@Autowired
public BooksController(BookServiceImpl bookService) {
    this.bookService = bookService;
}
